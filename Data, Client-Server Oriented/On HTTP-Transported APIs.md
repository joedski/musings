On HTTP-Transported APIs
========================

Also learning about what RESTfulness actually means.



## Research

1. While verbose, it may be worth using [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/) along with the attendant media types as a way to structure JSON responses.
    1. You can include a decent amount of metadata in the resposnes... or you can include them, but only optionally if they're unnecessary. (you only need pagination links sometimes, e.g.)
2. [Roy talking about how most web APIs aren't REST](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven).
    1. Think I need to read up more on what REST actually means.  Granted, I'm much better equipped to understand such things, now.
        1. NOTE: He does make a point to state that the REST architecture is not The One And Only Way, but merely a way to build APIs with longevity.  Other APIs over HTTP aren't wrong per se, they just aren't REST.
3. [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) which sounds like a bad thing is actually just the inclusion of what actions a client can perform against a given resources along side the representation of the resource itself that the client receive.
    1. As a simplistic example, a client may receive a blog post itself along with links that tell the client how to update or delete that post.
    2. The intent here is to keep the API for the resource itself discoverable by simply poking the resource, rather than relying on so called Out Of Band Information, e.g. documentation or a separate specification.
    3. As shown in [this example from the RESTful Cookbook](http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/), the server does not need to always return the same Links for a given Resource.  Rather, only the Links permitted by the server given the current stored state and client state should be sent to the client.
4. [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), a W3C standard for standardizing link information in JSON documents.
    1. Does not include permissable actions, though?  Or are those referred to by links?  Hm.
5. [Roy Fielding's Dissertation on the REST Architecture](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), including as applied to HTTP.  Should probably read this.
6. [A description of HATEOAS without calling it that](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/to-create-an-evolvable-api-stop-thinking-about-urls-2ad8b4cc208e) which is pretty readable, though I also read it much later.  I know more things, now, and have built more things, which may have made the reasoning more understandable.
    1. And while I'm not saying it's using anything in particular, the structure htey describe is suspiciously shaped like [JSON API][ss--json-api]...
7. [HAL][ss-7--hal-wikipedia] although the linked page may change from the terse description with examples I saw in 2019-03-22...
    1. [A better description][ss-7-1--hal] that's not just a Wikipedia Summary.
    2. Also note that HAL is meant to be transmittable in both XML and JSON.
8. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do with `content-type`.
    1. [This post][ss-8-1] actually gives a somewhat practical explanation, along with the suggestion that "using what \[they]â€™ve called standard media types give a client developer a leg-up".  Things like [JSON-API][ss--json-api] or [JSON+HAL][ss-7-1].

### Some Key Takeaways

1. For Hypermedia-driven APIs, _Media Types_ aren't any more useful than plain text (or a blob) unless standardized.
    1. Consider: As noted [in this post][ss-8-1], HTML has a media type of `text/html`, and although an HTML file is indeed a text file, it's specifically a text file whose contents are structured in accordance with the HTML standard, such as it is.  (granted, HTML is much more standard, now.)
    2. Consider: `application/json` isn't really all that useful because it tells you nothing about the actual structure therein.  All you know is it's JSON, so it may be a dictionary, array, or some primitives.  There are no standardized hypermedia things in there.
        1. One could argue that there is indeed only so much you can specify before you get into application-specific domains, but in counter point Hypermedia contains such application-specific stuff while still allowing a client to know before hand what certain Hypermedia-specific things enable, such as links to other thing.
    3. Consider: `application/hal+json` explicitly defines Links and Embedded Entities, which are additional to the Entity or other information made available in the response.
        1. Anyone who has read the HAL specification now knows what these special fields are for, and can use them to navigate the API available in much the same way they might navigate a(n HTML) website.
        2. This does not preclude out-of-band API Documentation, but it does make the API explorable without having to resort to such out-of-band information.  Any API meant for public consumption would thus benefit from this sort of structure.
        3. By defining a Hypermedia-friendly standard that can also make use of other standard things like Link Rels, both Automated and Human actors can make use of the available information.
        4. Aside: You can also use `application/hal+xml` if that's your jive.
        5. Along with that, you can define your own Rels or specify your exact usage of a given Rel with your own specific documentation, to fill in anything the document itself doesn't already provide.
            1. This is done via the CURIES mechanism, which allows you to define a CURIE key that can be prefixed to a Rel Key.  This CURIE Key is associated with a URL Template, into which the Rel Key can be substituted to yield a Documentation URL.
            2. This thus provides a standard way to create documentation links, making such documentation in-band information.  Or at least, less out-of-band.
            3. One could imagine some of this same machinery could be leveraged with Swagger documents.
