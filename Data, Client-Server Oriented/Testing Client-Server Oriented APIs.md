Testing Client-Server Oriented APIs
===================================

Need more research here.

I suppose part of this comes down to what exactly you're testing and what you _can_ test.  Is your code base setup such that you can actually test controller methods in isolation?  Can you stub/mock things?  Is your externally-facing part of the API autogenned to the point that testing it is really just testing someone else's library?  Hmmmmm.
