Vertical Resizing of Highcharts charts (in Vue)
===============================================

Gonna try looking into how to make Highcharts chart resize vertically, with a specific implementation in Vue.  Should be pretty easy to generalize elsewhere, mostly I just don't want to bother plugging in a resize observer myself.
