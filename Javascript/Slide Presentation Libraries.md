JS Slide Presentation Libraries
===============================

Always check the commit date on this for when it was last updated!

- [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)
  - All markdown driven.
  - Focuses on slides that appear the same on all platforms.
  - Probably the easiest to write. (although I don't know what flavor of markdown they use)
- [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
  - Slide based, but more HTML driven.
  - Can accept Markdown as an input, though.
  - Demo is more showoffy than remark's.
  - Supports broadcasting to multiple clients, say to peoples' phones, using a websockets server.
- [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js/)
  - Uses a prezi-style infinite canvas.
  - It's a little ostentatious for me.
- [Webslides](https://github.com/webslides/webslides/)
  - Not really sure.  Didn't get anything specific from the demo.
  - It was okay, but not great?  I think I'd have to dig in more to actually see what's what with it.
- [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js)
  - For if you need them to work in IE7.  (Site notes: Please don't give your presentations in IE6)
  - While I can't necessarily comment on feature support, it seems competent enough.
  - If I need a presentation that someone can run in damn near anything, then this would be it.
