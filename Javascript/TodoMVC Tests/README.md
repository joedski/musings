TodoMVC Tests
=============

Implementing TodoMVC in various client-side frameworks to get a taster of them.

These may or may not be feature complete, and may or may not conform to [their code style](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/codestyle.md).  Since they're mostly done with whatever I happen to be looking at for the moment, which may be some random UI framework or library that someone ~~pulled from the depths of their basement~~ wrote in a ~~weekend~~ month, they'll generally not be submitted for consideration.
