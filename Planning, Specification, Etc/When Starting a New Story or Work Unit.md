When Starting a New Story or Work Unit
======================================

Am I uncertain about certain elements?  Everything?

I'm attempting to document my process here, more as a way to (hopefully) solidify in my mind what it is I should do to avoid going too far in the wrong direction.



## Some Good Reading

1. [Joel on Why Bother With Functional Specs](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/)
  - I mean, preaching to the choir since I basically came to the conclusion that I need to draft specs long before I actually did anything smart like read what real devs do, but it's good to see someone more experienced lay their experience out and fill in the variably sized gaps in knowledge.



## Before Actual Planning: High Level Story Capture

Hopefully the Proposer has a clear idea of what they want, and I can go straight to internalization and seeking clarification.  If not, though, I may need to resolve one or more of the following situations.


### There's No Clear Idea About What's Expected: Seek More Literal User Story

Sometimes the proposer doesn't themselves have the clearest idea about what is needed, only that something is needed.  However, they may actually have a better idea than they think, so I need to try to coax it out of them.

Ask the proposer what they're seeing happening here, what they expect the user to go in and do, just step through what they're imagining if they were a user using this new thing.  Have them give


### No Clear Idea After Asking for Clarification

If they're still not getting anything, then devise some ideas, spend maybe an hour or two on this, then bring those ideas back to the original proposer and see if any of those are what they're feeling.



## After Starting Planning

Once both the proposer and I seem to be satisfied enough to start, begin planning in earnest, then step away for a bit.  Usually a night to sleep on it is good.  That done, create a new high-level summary of my plans and bring those back to the proposer, if they have time, just as a final confirmation.

This is done in case any of my more detailed plan points spark some other thoughts in the proposer and hopefully bring us closer to alignment.
