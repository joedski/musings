Musings (Public)
================

Musings about Things across Things.  Many times just process journals as I learn to use some library, but sometimes general amusements.  Likely to be notes coalecsed from across projects if they happen to coincide.



## Metadata with Front Matter

Extra metadata per-page for automation tooling.  Some of these [just so happen to coincide with Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).  Okay, mostly the `tags` key, but hey.

Supported Keys:

| Key | Usage |
| :-- | :--   |
| `tags` | The tags associated with this document for categorization purposes. |
| `summary` | A short one-to-two paragraph summary of the document. |

Quick example:

```md
