          ## That Don't Make You Hate Everything

          An Opinionated Rant

          ## Note About Examples

          - Typescript
          - `vue-class-component` and `vue-property-decorator`
          - Over all method applies to JS too, though
          - Probably more important in plain JS

          ## If Possible, Don't

          Instead, try...

          - Utility Classes and Functions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
          - Composing Components <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Scoped default slots can help
          - Vuex Modules <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Utility Classes and Functions
              - More verbose, better for low repetition things.
              - More explicit: next person sees how they're initialized on that component.
              - Easier to type in Typescript.
              - Cons:
                - Not as friendly to things which require lots of coordination.
                - Verbosity can be overwhelming/obscuring sometimes.
              - Mixed:
                - Sharing state across components is less well defined, not advisable.
            - Child Components with Scoped Default Slots
              - Hide all of the behavior in a fancy component.
              - Configure it with Props.
              - Get what it exposes via Scoped Slot Props.
              - Cons:
                - Doesn't give parent as much control.
            - Vuex Modules
              - Best suited to things which can in some way be generalized.
              - Behaviors explicitly defined.
              - Well-defined global access.
              - Cons:
                - Heavy Handed.
                - Verbose to specify.
              - Mixed:
                - Explicit initialization and clearing.
                - Data lifecycle tied to key rather than component lifecycle. (you have to do that)

          ### Sometimes Mixins Are Less Worse

          - A combination of features is repeated often (semi-baseclass)
          - Super annoying feature-set setup
          - Super annoying feature-set coordination
          - Super annoying lifecycle hook stuff
          - ~~Honestly hooks kinda ruin everything~~ (but they really kinda do)

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Kind of acts like a semi-baseclass, though baseclasses are annoying and non-compositional
            - Hooks and coordination of multiple things are annoying to repeat
            - Basically hooks kinda ruin everything

            ### If You Have To

            ## Namespace and Encapsulate

            1. Encapsulate all Mixin Behavior in a Controller <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            2. Write the Mixin Definition Separately <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            3. Prefix Component Names, Prop Names, and Event Names with Mixin Name <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              These items covered in more detail slides below.

              This is just an outline, so don't talk at length yet.

              Item 3 can also be stated "Prefix interface extensions with the mixin name", but that's not as defined and exact.

            ### Namespace and Encapsulate

            #1: Encapsulate all Mixin Behavior in a Controller

            - Class, Factory Function, etc
            - Controller can take Component as argument if needed
              - Better: expose component things via config
            - Controller can have own state
            - Can compose separate Controllers into bigger ones

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - State will be covered later under Tips.
              - Writing a controller with all the behavior means putting a controller instance on the component instance automatically namespaces all the actual behavior.
              - Keeps component interface cleaner.
                - Lower cognitive burden.
              - Mixed:
                - May be easier to test, but usually you'll need a component instance anyway, so, you can't really escape Vue there.
              - Composition of controllers is an idea to get used to, for reasons someone other than me will explain later.

            ### Namespace and Encapsulate

            #2: Write the Mixin Definition Separately

            - Define Props (Not Data!)
            - Instantiate, configure, and bind Controller
            - Call Controller's Lifecycle Hooks at appropriate Vue Hooks
            - Handle Provide/Inject
            - Should be only boring glue code

            ### Namespace and Encapsulate

            #3: Prefix Component Names, Prop Names, and Event Names with Mixin Name

            Example: `FooMixin`

            - Props: `foo-show`, `foo-current`
            - Events: `foo:show`, `foo:hide`
            - Components: `<foo-slide>`, `<foo-container>`

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              It's all about reinforcing where interface extensions are coming from.

              Interface extensions are evil, so to make them as least-evil as possible by namespacing things.  Future-you will hate you less.

      <section data-markdown>
        <script type="text/template">
          ## Key Benefits

          - Minimize component interface extensions (i.e. "surprises")
          - More obvious where props/components/events come from
          - Separate controllers allows for composability of mixin behaviors
          - Basically, it's nice to future-you

            Basically, be nice to future-you.

            Pro Tip: Don't be afraid to write controllers specific to a single component.

            ### Other Tips

            - Before creating a new mixin, start with a controller directly on a component
            - Try using controller-config to expose component-owned things the controller needs from the component
            - Add docblocks to your stuff or I will create a time machine to find you and judge you

            ### Other Tips: Reactive Controller State

            ~~Three~~ Two Options:
