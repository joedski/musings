          ## That Don't Make You Hate Everything

          An Opinionated Rant

          ## A Note About Examples

          - Examples in this talk are written using `vue-class-components`, `vue-property-decorator`, and Typescript.
          - The broader lessons apply just as well to plain Vue in vanilla JS.
          - I believe they are actually more important in that case.

            ## If Possible, Don't

            instead try

            - Utility Classes and Functions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Child Components with Scoped Default Slots <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Vuex Modules <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - Utility Classes and Functions
                - More verbose, better for low repetition things.
                - More explicit: next person sees how they're initialized on that component.
                - Easier to type in Typescript.
                - Cons:
                  - Not as friendly to things which require lots of coordination.
                  - Verbosity can be overwhelming/obscuring sometimes.
                - Mixed:
                  - Sharing state across components is less well defined, not advisable.
              - Child Components with Scoped Default Slots
                - Hide all of the behavior in a fancy component.
                - Configure it with Props.
                - Get what it exposes via Scoped Slot Props.
                - Cons:
                  - Doesn't give parent as much control.
              - Vuex Modules
                - Best suited to things which can in some way be generalized.
                - Behaviors explicitly defined.
                - Well-defined global access.
                - Cons:
                  - Heavy Handed.
                  - Verbose to specify.
                - Mixed:
                  - Explicit initialization and clearing.
                  - Data lifecycle tied to key rather than component lifecycle. (you have to do that)

          ### Sometimes Mixins Are Less Worse

          - Sometimes a combination is repeated quite often
          - Even worse, the setup is super annoying
          - Coordination between multiple things
          - Especially when lifecycle hooks are involved
          - Other reasons...

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - Kind of acts like a semi-baseclass, though baseclasses are annoying and non-compositional
            - Hooks and coordination of multiple things are annoying to repeat
            - Basically hooks kinda ruin everything

            ### If Do You Have To,

            ## Namespace and Encapsulate

            1. Encapsulate all Mixin Behavior in a Controller <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            2. Write the Mixin Definition Separately <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            3. Prefix Component Names, Prop Names, and Event Names with Mixin Name <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

            ## Namespace and Encapsulate

            #1: Encapsulate all Mixin Behavior in a Controller

            - Class, Factory Function, whatever flies your jet
            - Controller can take Component Instance for binding if needed
            - Controller can have own state if needed

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - State will be covered later under Tips.
              - Writing a controller with all the behavior means putting a controller instance on the component instance automatically namespaces all the actual behavior.
              - Keeps component interface cleaner.
                - Lower cognitive burden.
              - Mixed:
                - May be easier to test, but usually you'll need a component instance anyway, so, you can't really escape Vue there.

            ## Namespace and Encapsulate

            #2: Write the Mixin Definition Separately

            - Define Props
              - Not Data!  Keep state in the Controller!
            - Instantiate and bind Controller
            - Call Controller's Lifecycle Hooks at appropriate Vue Hooks
            - Handle Provide/Inject
            - Should be only boring glue code

            ## Namespace and Encapsulate

            #3: Prefix Component Names, Prop Names, and Event Names with Mixin Name

            - Mixins that add props and other components to a given component are extending the given component's interface
            - Events are always pretty much arbitrary
            - Prefixing the the names of props, events, and other components reminds future devs what added those things: the mixin

            #3: Prefix Component Names, Prop Names, and Event Names with Mixin Name

            Example: `FooMixin`

            - Props: `foo-show`, `foo-can-assume-direct-control`
            - Events: `foo:show`, `foo:hide`, `foo:assuming-direct-control`
            - Components: `<foo-current-collector>`, `<foo-lasers>`

          ## Key Benefits

          - Keeps component interface extensions minimal
          - More obvious where props/components/events come from
          - Separate controllers allows for composability of mixin behaviors

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - ... extensions minimal
              - The more you extend a component interface, the more congnitive burden you get
            - ... obvious where ... come from
              - Anything which helps code navigability saves developer time
            - ... composability of mixin behaviors
              - By breaking things out into separate controllers apart from all the component malarkey, you can compose controllers as necessary without worrying about mixin order.
              - Just create a new mixin with a new controller that composes the other controllers.

            ## Other Tips

            - Controller State and Reactivity
            - Mixin Config and Types in Typescript

            ## Other Tips

            ### Controller State and Reactivity

            - Controller State should cause reactive updates
            - Use `Vue.observable({ ... })` for just reactive state
            - Use a Renderless Vue Component for computed props that cache, watches, etc

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - Use ... just state
                - Controller Getters that access the State will still be reactive, they just won't cache heavy calculations.
              - Define ... for computed props, ...
                - This is what Vuex does.

            ## Other Tips

            ### Mixin Config and Types in Typescript

            Use a Parametrized Mixin

            ```typescript
            @Component
            class Foo extends Mixins(
              FooMixin({
                // stuff that might affect types
              })
            ) {
            }
            ```

            Technically that makes it a Mixin Factory, but Parametrized is more fun to say.

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - Takes the place of a config prop in the Vue Config Object.
              - If you're at the point where you care about types affected by Mixin Config, you probably know how to proceed from this example.
