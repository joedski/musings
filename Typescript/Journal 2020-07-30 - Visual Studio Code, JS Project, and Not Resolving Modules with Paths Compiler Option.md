Journal 2020-07-30 - Visual Studio Code, JS Project, and Not Resolving Modules with Paths Compiler Option
========

Tried a bunch of things.

Eventually found [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/12618).

Tried suggestion of deleting `files` and `includes` options.

That worked.  Not exactly sure why, but oh well.  I'm tired.
