The Transition Element and Templates
====================================

I couldn't find anything about putting things contained in a `<template>` within a `<transition>` element after an exhaustive research session consisting of 2 whole google searches, with words like `vue`, `transition`, and `template`, so I'm going to see directly if this is a supported use case.

Result?

```
[Vue warn]: <transition> can only be used on a single element. Use <transition-group> for lists.
```

Ah well.  Now I know.
